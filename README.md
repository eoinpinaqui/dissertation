# Game Description
The game is played by four players. Each player aims to destroy the bases of the other players. 
They do this by controlling their navy and firing missiles from their ships.

Players earn gold and ammo over time. Occasionally, bonuses appear that give extra gold and ammo to whichever player 
collects them. Players can purchase boats using gold. There are three types of boats:
- Scouts are cheap and die when hit by one missile. They move much faster than normal boats, but fire missile at a slow pace.
- Gunners have a medium cost and die when hit by two missiles. They move at a medium pace, but can fire missiles rapidly.
- Tanks are expensive and die when hit by four missiles. They move slowly and fire missiles at a medium pace.

Each player controls one boat at a time and can switch between them freely. A player is eliminated when their base take ten hits. 
Players gain points based on when they go out:
- First to be eliminated: -150 points
- Second to be eliminated: -50 points
- Third to be eliminated: 50 points
- Win: 300 points
